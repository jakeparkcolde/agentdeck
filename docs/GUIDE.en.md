# agentdeck guide

Written for first-time users: **what you need → install → set up each feature**.
You don't have to turn everything on. **LLM quotas and the pomodoro work right after install**; enable the rest as you need it.

## 1. What you need

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Ulanzi Stream Controller D200** | 13 keys plus one wide screen tile. Pick **the cheapest or any seller you like** from the [AliExpress search results](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-ulanzi-d200.html); there's also the [Ulanzi store](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/stream-deck-d200). ⚠️ The similarly named **D200X** (with knobs) and **D200H** are different models and have not been tested. Make sure the listing says just **D200**. |
| **A Mac** | Tested on Apple Silicon. |
| **USB cable** | Plug the included USB-C cable straight into your Mac. |

> 💡 **The firmware is never touched.** This program runs on your Mac and only sends screens to the device. Quit it and the device goes back to normal.

## 2. Install

### 2-1. Check the basics

Open Terminal (search "Terminal" in Spotlight) and run:

```bash
python3 --version   # 3.11 or newer
git --version
```

If either is missing, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run:

```bash
brew install python git
```

### 2-2. Download and set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakeparkcolde/agentdeck.git
cd agentdeck
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.example.json config.json
```

### 2-3. First run

1. **Quit Ulanzi Studio completely**, including its menu-bar icon. Two programs can't drive the device at once.
2. Plug in the device.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python dashboard.py
   ```
4. If the screen changes, you're done. Press `Ctrl+C` in Terminal to stop.

### 2-4. Start automatically at login

```bash
./scripts/install-launchd.sh
```

It now starts at login and restarts within 15 seconds if it stops. Unplugging and replugging the device is handled too.

| To do this | Run |
|---|---|
| Restart after editing the config | `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.agentdeck.dashboard` |
| Watch the log | `tail -f dashboard.log` |

## 3. Screen basics

```
┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
│ 1  │ 2  │ 3  │ 4  │ 5  │   ← tiles that change per page (10)
├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
│ 6  │ 7  │ 8  │ 9  │ 10 │
├────┼────┼────┼─────────┤
│ ◀  │home│ ▶  │  wide   │   ← shared buttons + wide tile (clock, etc.)
└────┴────┴────┴─────────┘
```

| Button | Tap | Hold (0.8 s+) |
|---|---|---|
| ◀ / ▶ | Previous / next page | — |
| Middle | Go **Home** (shortcuts) and refresh now | Cycle brightness (20 → 50 → 80 → 100) |

**Intro and Home**: on start the keys light up in a wave and spell **AGENT / DECK** one letter per key for about 3 seconds (any key skips), then **Home** appears. Its 10 keys are **shortcuts** to every page, and the wide tile lists **what's new** since you last looked (tap for more).

**Updates**: once a day it checks GitHub for a new version; if there is one, the clock and Home show **"Update N"**. On Home or a page with the clock, **hold the wide tile for 2 seconds** to download it (installing packages if needed) and restart. If it would clash with files you edited locally, it stops and tells you instead (your edits are never thrown away).

**Colours mean the same thing on every page:**

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟩 Green | Plenty left, healthy, finished |
| 🟨 Yellow | Caution, needs your decision |
| 🟥 Red | Danger, nearly empty, waiting to confirm a delete |
| 🟦 Blue | Working |
| **Blinking** | Look now. Press it to jump there and stop the blinking. |

## 4. Features in detail

### 4.1 Remaining LLM quota (pages 1-2)

<img src="images/page1-summary.en.png" width="560">

**What it shows**
- Remaining quota for **Claude, Codex and agy**, both the 5-hour and weekly windows. The big number is whichever is **tighter**.
- **Pace** tells you whether you're spending faster than time passes. If you've used 50% of the weekly quota but only 30% of the week has gone by, you're "too fast".
- **Best now** recommends the LLM with the most room.
- **Page 2** shows the same data as a grid: columns are LLMs, top row 5-hour, bottom row weekly. If enabled, [Flow · Higgsfield credits](#410-flow--higgsfield-credits-optional) follow in the next columns.
- **Services you don't use are hidden.** If there is no Codex folder (`~/.codex`) or no `agy` setting, that column is dropped and the rest shift left, so a Claude-only setup doesn't look empty.

**How to enable**

| LLM | Setup |
|---|---|
| **Claude** | Put the wrapper in front of the Claude Code status line (see below). |
| **Codex** | Automatic if you're logged in to Codex CLI (`~/.codex/auth.json`). |
| **agy** | Set the machine that runs agy under `agy` in `config.json`. |

**Claude example** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

```jsonc
// If you already had a status-line command, append it after the wrapper
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "/Users/me/agentdeck/statusline-tee.sh your-original-command"
}
// No status line before? The wrapper alone is fine
"statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "/Users/me/agentdeck/statusline-tee.sh"}
```

> Claude numbers refresh only while you use Claude Code; otherwise the last value stays.
> ⚠️ The Codex lookup uses undocumented internal endpoints and may change at any time.

agy uses the official CLI JSON command over SSH. It requires CLI 1.1.11+ and an existing authenticated installation; failures leave quota unavailable. **Local CLI execution and live SSH collection/parsing passed with agy 1.5.3; dashboard integration and Korean/English rendering also passed; physical D200 validation was unavailable because no device was present**; see [details](ANTIGRAVITY.md).

### 4.2 Agent activity (page 3)

<img src="images/page3-studio.en.gif" width="560">

**What it shows**: running Claude Code and Codex agents, **grouped by project**.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Decide N** (yellow blink) | Waiting for a permission or an answer |
| **Done N** (green blink) | Finished and you haven't looked yet |
| **Working N** (blue border) | Running |
| **Idle** | Waiting for your next instruction |
| `C2 X1 · run 1` | Counts for C = Claude, X = Codex, A = agy, then how many are running now |

**Pressing a tile**
- A blinking tile takes you **to the window that agent lives in** and stops the blinking.
- Press the same tile again to move to the next session or tab in that project.

**Pick one of two modes** (`agent_source` in `config.json`)

#### A. Hooks (`"hooks"`, recommended)
Works **wherever the agent runs**: VS Code, Cursor, iTerm, Ghostty, Terminal…

```bash
python3 scripts/install-hooks.py           # Claude Code
python3 scripts/install-hooks.py --codex   # plus Codex (your existing notify is kept)
```

Sessions **started after installing** show up. Pressing a tile does this:

| Agent runs in | On press |
|---|---|
| iTerm2, Terminal | Jumps to that exact tab |
| VS Code, Cursor | Brings that project window forward |
| Ghostty and other apps | Brings the app forward |
| Another Mac | Display only |

To see agents on other Macs, run `install-hooks.py` there too and add their SSH hosts to `hooks.hosts`.

> Not counted as alerts: non-interactive runs launched by other programs (such as `claude -p`) are treated as sub-tasks. Agents that aren't CLIs, such as some editor extensions, may not appear.

#### B. Herdr (`"herdr"`)
If you manage agents with [Herdr](https://herdr.dev), this mode gives you more:
- The top row shows **lead panes** with their sub-agents. Press a pane to **zoom** it, press again to restore.
- Set the Herdr host, lead space and tab names, and lead pane under `studio` (see [config reference](#5-full-config-reference)).

### 4.3 Worktrees

<img src="images/worktrees.en.png" width="560">

**Press the wide tile on page 3** to open it. Git worktrees grouped by state:

| State | Meaning | Hold twice to |
|---|---|---|
| Stale | Uncommitted changes and nobody working on it | Ask the lead agent to tidy up |
| Mergeable | Fully merged into main, no changes | Remove the worktree (branch is kept) |
| Old | Unmerged commits, untouched for 3+ days | Ask to tidy up |
| Working | An agent is working in that folder | Ask to tidy up |

- **Tap** to open the worktree.
- **Hold once to arm (red), then hold again within 10 seconds to run.** This prevents accidental deletes.
- To enable, set `studio.host` (where the worktrees live) and `studio.worktree_globs` (where to look). Cleanup requests go to `studio.lead_pane`, which currently needs Herdr.

### 4.4 Machines and device detail (page 4)

<img src="images/page4-machines.en.png" width="560">

**What it shows**: CPU, memory and disk on several Macs, plus free space on external drives. With [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole) installed you also get a **health score** and reclaimable space.

**Press a machine tile to open its detail page.**

<img src="images/device.en.png" width="560">

- The top 2 CPU processes. Anything hogging the CPU for over 5 minutes turns red.
- **Clean caches & logs** removes app caches, logs and temp files (`mo clean`). System caches that need admin rights are skipped; only your user area is cleaned.
- **Purge build artifacts** removes things like `node_modules`, `.venv` and `dist` (`mo purge`). ⚠️ Active projects may need a reinstall afterwards.
- **Empty Trash** deletes permanently.
- All three need a **double hold** to run; a tap just explains what would be removed.

**How to enable**

1. **Other Macs (optional)** need password-less SSH. The easiest route is [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on every Mac, then on this one:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519            # only if you have no key
   ssh-copy-id user@other-mac
   ssh user@other-mac echo ok       # prints ok when it works
   ```
2. **Mole (optional)**: `brew install mole` on each Mac
3. Add them under `machines` in `config.json`. This Mac is `"ssh": null`; set `"mole": true` where Mole is installed.

### 4.5 Pomodoro (page 5)

<img src="images/page5-pomodoro.en.gif" width="560">

1. Press a duration from 5 to 90 minutes to start.
2. The ten cells drain **from the last one backwards**. The wide tile shows time left and the end time.
3. **Tap** any tile to pause, then press the "Cancel" tile; or **hold** to cancel.
4. When it ends, it jumps to page 5 from wherever you are, blinks, and sends a macOS notification with a sound.

> The timer survives dashboard restarts.

### 4.6 Korean stock heatmap (page 6)

<img src="images/page6-heatmap.en.gif" width="560">

Korean stocks coloured by daily change: **red is up, blue is down** (the Korean convention), stronger colour for bigger moves. The wide tile shows KOSPI and KOSDAQ plus the number of rising and falling stocks.

| Each tap of the middle button shows | |
|---|---|
| KOSPI top | Top 10 KOSPI stocks by market cap |
| KOSDAQ top | Top 10 KOSDAQ stocks by market cap |
| Sector movers | Today's 5 best and 5 worst sectors |
| My portfolio | Stock codes in `market.portfolio` (e.g. `"005930"`) |
| Watched sectors | 10 sector names in `market.sectors` (Naver Finance names) |
| FX · commodities · rates | USD/KRW, 100JPY/KRW, EUR/KRW, dollar index, WTI, Brent, gold, silver, US 10Y and 2Y yields. Value large, change below; yields change in bp |

- Pressing a tile opens a **new Chrome tab**; with the [HeatTab](https://heattab.app) extension installed, that tab is the full heatmap.
- Refreshes every minute while this page is shown.
- To enable: `"market": {"enabled": true, "portfolio": [...], "sectors": [...]}` in `config.json`
- ⚠️ Uses **undocumented Naver Finance endpoints**. For reference only, not investment advice.

### 4.7 Games (page 7)

<img src="images/page7-games.en.gif" width="560">

The top ten keys become the game board. The menu shows seven games; press one to start. The wide tile is the scoreboard, and best scores are saved.

| Game | How to play |
|---|---|
| 🔨 **Whack-a-mole** | 30 seconds to bop moles as they pop up. +1 per mole, **golden mole +3**, **bomb −3** if you hit it. It speeds up and starts sending two at a time |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Keys light up in order; press them back in the same order. Each round adds one more, and a wrong key ends the game, marking it with ✕ and the right one with ! |
| 🃏 **Pairs** | Find five pairs of aquarium friends (fish, octopus, crab, turtle, shark). Every card shows for 1.5 s at the start. **Fewer tries** is a better score |
| 🃏 **Blackjack** | The four left keys on the top row are the dealer's cards and the bottom row are yours. **DEAL** (top right) starts a hand; then **HIT** or **STAND**, or press the wide tile on your first two cards to **double** (twice the bet, one more card). The bottom-right key picks a bet of 1, 2, 5 or 10 coins. The dealer draws to 16 and stands on 17. Blackjack pays 3:2 |
| 🂡 **Poker duel** | Five-card draw against the computer. **The top row is your opponent** (the first two cards are face up) and **the bottom row is you**. Before a hand, pick a bet (1, 2, 5 or 10) on the bottom row and press **DEAL**. **Tap your own cards to hold them**, then press the **wide tile** to draw. The opponent draws too, then everything is revealed. A win pays even money, with a bonus for winning with a straight or better (straight 4x · flush 6 · full house 9 · four of a kind 25 · straight flush 50 · royal flush 250). Afterwards any key deals again with the same bet and the wide tile changes the bet |
| 🏇 **Horse race** | **The top five keys join into one race track** and five horses run from the starting gate on the left to the finish line on the right. **The bottom row shows the runners** (number, name, odds). Tap horses on the bottom row to pick them (tap again to drop one). **The number of horses sets the bet type**: 1 horse is a **Win** bet (pick the winner), 2 is a **Quinella** (both finish 1st and 2nd, any order) or an **Exacta** (1st and 2nd in the order you picked; with two horses picked, a **Quinella ⇄ Exacta** switch appears on the top-left key) and 3 is a **Trio** (all three finish in the top 3, any order). While waiting, **bet chips** (1, 2, 5, 10 coins) float over the top-row track; tap one to set your stake, then press the **wide tile** to start after a 3-2-1 countdown. During the race the bottom row shows live positions and the wide tile commentates ("#3 Bolt takes the lead!", "Final stretch, neck and neck!"). Each horse has its own form swings and finishing kick, so lead changes are common. Once the race starts the track grows to **the top two rows (10 keys)**, and as the leader nears the line **the whole device, bottom keys and wide tile included, becomes one big slow-motion close-up of the finish**, then freeze with a shutter flash for a **photo finish** before returning to the normal view. A winning bet pays **bet × odds**. Odds for every bet type and combination come from running each race card 1,200 times in advance, so a higher number means a longer shot. The odds on each horse card are its Win odds; the wide tile shows the odds for the combination you picked. Afterwards any key brings up the next race |
| 🎰 **Slots** | Press a side key (the lever) to spin three reels for 1 coin, then stop each with the **STOP** key below it. Three alike pays 50 for 7s, 30 diamonds, 15 stars, 10 bells, 6 lemons, 5 cherries; any two alike pays 2. You start with 20 coins (shared with blackjack, poker and the horse race) and get 20 more if you run out |

- Keys react **the moment you press**, not on release.
- After a game, press the board to play again or the **middle button** for the menu. The middle button also quits a game in progress.
- The screensaver stays off while you play.
- **Sound effects**: the D200 has no speaker, so sounds play on the Mac the deck is plugged into (mole hits, memory notes, cards, slots, the race bell, hooves, slow-motion whoosh and crowd cheer, and more). Add `"sound": {"enabled": true, "volume": 0.6}` to `config.json` to turn them on; they are off by default.

### 4.8 Chill screensavers: aquarium · fire · rain · beach

<img src="images/page8-aquarium.gif" width="560">

The whole deck (13 keys plus the wide tile) becomes **one screen** showing a pixel-art aquarium. Fish swim across key borders, seaweed sways and bubbles rise. **Pufferfish** sometimes puff up with spikes, **jellyfish** pulse and drift, and **crabs** scuttle sideways on the sand and pick up food that sinks to the bottom. A **turtle** cruises slowly, and an **octopus** crawls on the sand, now and then shooting upward with a puff of ink and changing colour. A **shark** patrols and now and then dashes, and nearby fish scatter.

Press **Aquarium** on the Home screen to pick one of four scenes. Each uses the whole deck as one screen, with a matching **ambient loop** on the Mac speaker (when sound is on).

| Scene | Picture | Tap | Ambient |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🐠 Aquarium | the pixel-art aquarium above | food | water · bubbles |
| 🔥 Fire | a stacked log fire in a stone fireplace, sparks and embers | throw a log, the fire flares up | crackling wood |
| 🌧️ Rain | a rainy night street seen from a window: blurred lights, a street lamp, wet road, drops on the glass, a plant and a mug on the sill | lightning · thunder | rain |
| 🌊 Beach | a sunset beach: sun on the horizon, glittering water, waves rolling in and out, gulls | a big wave | waves |

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| **Tap** any key | scene action (table above) |
| **Hold** any key | back to the scene picker if you came in yourself, or to the page you were on if it started as the screensaver |

- It starts as soon as you reach page 8, and on its own after **10 idle minutes**. Change that with `"screensaver_min"` in `config.json`; `0` turns the auto start off.
- An **agent alert or a finished pomodoro** pulls you straight out to the right page.
- Redraws 5 times a second; each frame is about 11 KB, so it's light on the device.

### 4.9 AliExpress parcel ETAs (optional)

Set `"parcels": {"enabled": true}` in `config.json` to add a **parcels page** after Games. AliExpress orders are shown per box (orders sharing a tracking number are grouped).

- Each key shows the item, **"Today / Tomorrow / in 3d"** and a stage bar (ordered → shipped → in transit → customs → local delivery → out for delivery → delivered). Parcels arriving today blink, and the clock shows a "Parcels today N" chip.
- The wide tile charts **expected arrivals for the next two weeks**. Tap a parcel for its tracking events; **hold to open AliExpress tracking** in the Mac browser.
- **Log in once**: `.venv/bin/python parcels_import.py login` opens a dedicated Chrome window; sign in to AliExpress yourself. This profile (`~/.cache/d200/ali-browser`) is separate from your everyday Chrome.
- After that it re-imports orders, tracking numbers and ETAs **headlessly every 3 hours**, and refreshes tracking every 30 minutes. Run `.venv/bin/python parcels_import.py` to import now.
- Safety: no password is stored or typed by the program. It only talks to the browser on this Mac (127.0.0.1) and only presses the **"View orders / load more"** button on the orders page (never confirm-received or cancel). Data stays in `~/.cache/d200/parcels.json`.
- You can also add a tracking number by hand: `.venv/bin/python parcels.py add <tracking> "item name"`.

### 4.10 Flow · Higgsfield credits (optional)

Google Flow and Higgsfield only show remaining credits **on their websites**. When enabled, they appear on page 2 in the columns after your LLMs.

- **Top tile**: credits left. Flow also shows time until reset; Higgsfield shows a bar against the monthly allowance.
- **Bottom tile**: plan name and when it was last read. It turns grey if it could not be read for over 3 hours.

**How to enable**
1. Turn on only the services you use in `config.json`: `"flow": {"enabled": true}`, `"higgsfield": {"enabled": true}`.
2. **Log in once**: `.venv/bin/python web_credits.py login flow` (or `login higgsfield`). A dedicated Chrome window opens; sign in yourself and close it. It shares the parcels feature's dedicated profile (`~/.cache/d200/ali-browser`).
3. Restart the dashboard; credits are read **headlessly every 30 minutes**. Run `.venv/bin/python web_credits.py` to read now.

- Safety: no password is stored or typed by the program. It only talks to the browser on this Mac (127.0.0.1). For Flow it opens the account panel and reads the credits line; for Higgsfield it only reads the subscription settings page text. It never presses sign-out, purchase or upgrade buttons.
- Only the credit count, monthly allowance, reset time and plan name are saved (`~/.cache/d200/flow.json`, `higgsfield.json`). No email or name.
- ⚠️ This reads web pages rather than an official API, so a site redesign can break it. The last value then stays, greyed out.

## 5. Full config reference

Everything lives in `config.json`. **Anything you leave out is turned off.** Restart the dashboard after editing.

```jsonc
{
  "ui_lang": "en",              // on-device language: "en" or "ko"
  "screensaver_min": 10,        // idle minutes before the screensaver (0 = off)
  "screensaver_scene": "aqua",  // screensaver scene: aqua · fire · rain · beach, or alternate
  "sound": {"enabled": false, "volume": 0.6},  // sound effects and ambience on the Mac speaker
  "parcels": {"enabled": false},  // AliExpress parcel ETA page
  "flow": {"enabled": false},       // Google Flow credits (page 2)
  "higgsfield": {"enabled": false}, // Higgsfield credits (page 2)
  "aquarium_fish": 14,          // number of fish in the aquarium
  "agent_source": "hooks",      // agent view: "hooks" or "herdr"
  "hooks": {
    "hosts": [null, "studio"]   // where to read hook state (null = this Mac)
  },
  "machines": [                 // computers shown on page 4
    {"name": "MacBook", "ssh": null,     "mole": true},
    {"name": "Studio",  "ssh": "studio", "mole": true}
  ],
  "external_drives": [          // drives to show (volume name, machine name)
    {"volume": "My Book", "machine": "Studio"}
  ],
  "studio": {                   // Herdr mode + worktrees
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "studio",           // machine running Herdr / holding worktrees
    "tower_space": "CONTROL_TOWER",
    "tower_main_tab": "lead",
    "lead_pane": "t1",          // lead pane that receives cleanup requests
    "worktree_globs": ["~/worktrees/*/*"]
  },
  "agy": {"enabled": true, "host": "studio"}
}
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The screen doesn't change | Fully quit Ulanzi Studio, replug the device, restart the dashboard |
| Pressing keys types text | The dashboard isn't running, so the device is in its default keyboard mode. Check `dashboard.log` |
| No agents show up (hooks) | Only sessions **started after installing** appear. Check that files appear in `~/.cache/d200/agents` |
| Another Mac shows "OFF" | Make sure `ssh host echo ok` works without a password |
| Emptying Trash on this Mac asks for permission | Allow "control Finder" once |
| Claude quota shows "-" | Check the status-line wrapper and use Claude Code once |

## 7. Uninstall

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.agentdeck.dashboard
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentdeck.dashboard.plist
python3 scripts/install-hooks.py --uninstall   # if you installed hooks
```

Restore your Claude status-line setting and delete the folder. The device works with Ulanzi Studio again right away.
